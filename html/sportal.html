        </a>
    </div>
</section>

<section>
  <div class="block">
      <p><span class="first-character sc">T</span>hese courses are designed to assess and improve your mathematical abilities in preperation for placement in Geometry. </p>
    
    <p class="margin-top-10">But before you get started with the material, there are some basic skills that you should review, in order to enhance your chances of success. <strong>Basic Skill #1: you must practice taking useful notes</strong>.</p>
    <p>Good "useful" note-taking is based on a clear sense of why you are taking notes in the first place. Once you understand the importance of taking notes (and the strategies behind doing so), you will be able to make your notes much more useful - rather than just jotting things down randomly because everyone else is too!</p>
    
    <p>Here are some of the benefits of taking <strong>useful</strong> notes:</p>
    
    <ul>
       <li>You will have useful class records at your service 24 hours a day, covering important points/ tips from each lecture.</li>
       <li>You will know when each topic was covered, as your notes will be in chronological order.</li>
       <li>You will improve your writing skills overall; by learning how to organize new information, your questions,and ideas on paper.</li>
       <li>You will understand each lesson better, by only focusing on what information is important to you, and thinking through where/ how your notes fit together.</li>
       <li>Your memory of each day's lesson will improve, and subsequently</li>
       <li>You will have an easier time preparing for/ completing homework, quizzes, and exams.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Now that you have a general sense of why note taking is important, you can begin to ask yourself the following questions at the beginning of each class period:</p>
    
    <p>'Why am I taking notes today?' 'What key points are useful in today's lesson?' 'Which parts of today's lesson do I understand clearly?' 'Which parts of today's lesson did I not understand?' 'What questions, if any, do I still have from yesterday's lesson?' 'What topics will I need to review later (or get extra help for)?' </p>

<p>As you're thinking like a student, take some time now to copy the following <strong>general principles for taking notes</strong> into your class notebook. List the following points on or near to the very first page of your notebook:</p>

<p>1. My classnotes must be in chronological order, from the beginning of the semester until the final lesson, 2. My notes should be brief and clear. I won't always need to copy everything down because I can underline, use color pencils or highlighters, or my own shorthand/ abbreviations. 3. I will make comments in my notebook about how today's lesson relates to previous knowledge (topics I have already covered). This may help me understand new material faster, 4. My notes must be legible enough for me to read later. If I can't read my own notes, they're useless!, 5. I will always include the proper heading (names, dates, topics covered, the agenda for that day), 6. My notes should only be located in one place - inside my Algebra Nootebook. </p> 

      <p>As your teacher, I will do my very best during the semester to make each lesson interesting and engaging.</p> 

<p> However, no matter how you slice it, taking notes during a lecture is always a pain in the @$$. Nevertheless, <strong>you must do your part by developing good listening skills</strong>. Some of my brightest students, in the past, have made grade altering mistakes because of an inability or unwillingness to listen and follow directions.</p>

<p>Pay attention!</p> 

<p>Your individual focus is your own responsibility. Practice concentrating on the "main points" of each lesson. Listen for those vocal cues which will highlight what's important: "This point is crucial...", "Another method for solving this problem is...", " I repeat that...", etc...</p>

<p>Part of your homework each night, for these courses, should be to reveiw and recall the notes from today's lesson.</p> 

      <p><strong>Review your notes as soon as you can while they are still relatively fresh (&lt;12 hours old) in your mind</strong>. Add new thoughts or questions to your notebook. Bring those questions into class the next day and ask them! Better notes will improve your overall performance in these courses.</p>

    <h2>Organized students almost always outperform their peers</h2>
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  <div class="block">
      <p><span class="first-character ny">A</span>s high school students, the academic expectations for you have increased dramatically. Negative attitudes, tardiness, late homework, and laziness are <strong>not acceptable</strong>. All of your teachers here at St. Benedict's will expect more of you as students than before, as will your parents and friends. Life will get pretty hectic for you - very quickly. The secret to making your academic life here a success lies within your ability to <strong>stay on top of your work by being organized</strong>.</p> 

<p><strong>Basic Skill #2: Keep "your" world organized</strong>. As a kid, you have almost no control over your home. Your parent(s)/ guardian(s) make(s) the major decisions.</p>
 
<p>However, you do have full control over your academic life here at St. Benedict's. Your success or failure is entirely on you - regardless of what home looks like.</p>

<p>There are five parts to successfully organizing your academic life here (for any class):</p>

<p><strong>Part 1: Keep &amp; Use your Planner</strong></p> 

<p> Your planner will be one of your most useful tools during high school. If you are a freshman (FY), you should receive one during the overnight.</p>

      <p>The purpose of your planner is to help you organize the important information of your daily schedules. <strong><i>LIFE NOTES</i></strong>, so to speak. Your planner should hold all of your homework assignments, doctor's appointments, club meetings, sports practices, parties, etc... And follow the same guideleines of useful note taking.</p>
      
<p>Your planner must be neat and organized, and give you a brief and simple way to see your schedule and assignments for the day (week, month, or year).  Even if you are not a freshman, there are still practical ways to keep your life notes:</p>
      
<p><img src="images/googlecalendar.png.gif" alt="Google Calendar" style=""> is a convenient way to create a cloud based planner that will sync with all of your devices both at school and at home. This service is incuded with your school gmail account, which you will (or should have) recieved during your orientation. Instructions for how to acess and utilize your Google calendar can be found <a href="help.html">here</a>.</p>

      <p><strong>Freshmen (FY)</strong>, you are allowed to utilize the functionality of Google calendar as your planner for my course. However, it may only be used as a <i>supplement</i>. You are still required to use the planner that was given to you during orientation. <strong>The organization and daily use of your planner will affect your overall grade</strong>. The Google calendar that syncs to your phone, tablet, and computer will serve as a back up.</p>

<p><strong>Part 2: Take Useful Notes (Every Day)</strong></p>

<p>We have already reviewed the guidelines and steps for useful note taking above. But you should take a few hours each week, to examine your notebook and the <a href="#firststeps">section above</a> to ensure that you are still on track.</p>    
      
<p><strong>Part 3: Organizing Your Physical School Materials</strong></p> 

<p> For my courses, you will be required to print out the vast majority our of class work on your own. To make matters worse, you will also receive paper materials (readings, project instructions, syllabi, permission slips, homework, reutrned quizzes, etc.) from all of your other classes.</p>
      
<p> Therefore, you need to keep the three major physical compents of your academic life in order:</p>
      
      <p><strong><u>Your Folders &amp; Notebooks</u>**</strong></p>
      
      <p>Don't just stuff or fold your handouts into a random notebook/ textbook!</p>
      
      <p>Keeping track of your papers has two obvious benefits: 1. You will be able to verify your grades with teachers and 2. Your handouts will serve as useful study aids for those upcoming quizzes and tests.</p>
      
      <p>Make a separate folder or binder for each class. This will allow you to have the most storage space per class.  Give each class folder a different, distinct design or color and label them all clearly with your name, the course, and your teacher's name.</p> 
          
          <p>Avoid jamming papers into the pockets of your binders. Use your commong sense; if your handouts cannot fit into your binder's pockets, grab a simple three hole puncher - at least one of your teachers will have access to one.</p>
      
      <p>Also, be sure to get a separate notebook for each of your classes. <i>It may seem like a great idea to have one huge five subject notebook for all your classes</i>, but you'll just be creating a nightmare for yourself down the road.</p> 
      
      <p> <strong>If you misplace your "5 Subject Notebook", you will end up in serious trouble for all of your courses. </strong></p>
      
      <p> No teacher, on any level, is interested in hearing how you lost your homework when you misplaced your gigantic notebook. DO NOT BUY THEM! The best option for each of you, by far, is to have a separate notebook for each class. If for some legitimate reason you cannot obtain a separate notebook for each course, inform Mr. White of the problem, or at least reduce the likelyhood that you'll lose everything by purchasing the two or three subject ones.</p>
      
      <p> <strong>**Sprial Notebook Pockets</strong>: For your classes which are heavy on notes and light on handouts is also a fairly good system, if you can make it work. You are still encouraged to have one extra folder for each course just in case your handouts and returned assignments outgrow the pockets within your notebook.</p>
      
      <p><strong><u>Your Bookbag</u></strong></p>
      
      <p>Keep your bookbag in good shape. Students at St. Benedict's are not allowed to carry their bookbags with them during the day. So that should reduce the wear and tear on your backpack.</p>
      
      <p>Nevertheless, it is still impossible to be organized if your bookbag is littered with food wrappers and random scraps of paper. Clean out your bookbag frequently and keep it clean! Discard everything that is obviously garbage, and sort through the rest. Take your textbooks home (if your teacher gives you permission to do so) and keep your old assignments organized at home.</p>
      
      <p>Thankfully for you, all of my Algebra course materials are digital. But you will not have this luxury in all of your classes. Keep your notebooks, folders, and binder(s) organized. Your grades will be better for it in the end. <strong><i>N.B. If it is possible, keep a different bag for your practice gear as well. Mixing your practice gear with your class materials is often a recipe for disaster</i></strong>.</p>
      
      
      <p><strong><u>Your Locker</u></strong></p>
      
      <p> Don't jam your locker with loose handouts, old folders, and broken pencils. <strong>We do not allow locks on lockers here at St. Benedict's</strong>. So if your locker is always organized, you will reduce the chance of misplacing your things.</p> 
      
      <p>The easiest things to do, to help keep your locker organzed, are to: 1. Keep your notebooks, folders, and binder(s) organized. 2. Keep your bookbag is order. 3. Carry a seperate bag for your practice gear. </p>
      
      <p> One final simple idea would be to keep a plastic file organizer inside your locker.</p>
      
      <p>Plastic file accordions can serve as a simple filing system for all of your papers. These organizers are lightweight, compact, and easy to seperate into class specific sections.</p>
      
<p><strong>Part 4: Have an Organized Study Area at Home</strong></p>       

<p>Create a designated space for you to complete your homework at home. Your homework/ study space should be well lit, slightly uncomfrtable (to keep you awake), and well organized. You should have enough space to neatly store and returned assignments, handouts, study materials, and your textbooks.</p>
      
<p>If for whatever reason, studying at home is not a viable option for you, speak to someone about the issue immediately - your counselor, a teacher, a coach, or your group advisor. The property of St.Benedict's is essentially open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. </p>

<p><strong>Complete your homework at school, after practice and before you return home if you have to. Find a way to make your life work!</strong></p>
      
      
<p><strong>Part 5: Develop Good Interpersonal Habits</strong></p> 
    <p>Remember, that your success is entirely dependant on you:</p>
       <ul>
           <li><strong>Routine, routine, routine!</strong> Following the same habits everyday will make you a better student.</li>
       <li>Communicate effectively with your teachers and older peers. No one will want to help you if you are disrespectful.</li>
       <li>Don't be bashful! Ask for help if you need it. No one can do it all alone. ASK and you will receive the assistance that you need.</li>

    <p><span class="first-character atw">W</span>hile moving through the semester, you should pay particular attention to your performance on assignments [Homework, Quizzes, Exams, etc.]. If you find yourself having a difficult time with the work, it is <strong>your responsibility </strong>to seek extra help.</p> 
      
      <p><strong>Basic Skill #3: Seek Extra Help - <i>whenever necessary</i></strong></p>
      
      <p>There is no excuse for not seeking help after school. ALL coaches at St. Benedict's support their student athletes in acheiving their academic pusuits. If you bring a note from your teacher (or tutor), your coaches will not penalize you or your teammates for arriving late to practice.</p>
      
      <p>Establish a clear channel of communication between your teachers and coaches and you will be fine.</p>
      
          <p class="margin-top-10"><strong>Mr. Marlow's FY Homework Help - Room 44</strong></p>

      <p>My Algebra students are encouraged to initially seek help from Mr. Marlow after school from 3:30 p.m. - 4:30 p.m. in Room 44 of the Old Building. <strong>Attendance records for these homework help sessions are recorded on a daily basis.</strong> This will enable me to verify that you are making the extra effort to be successful in your studies.</p> 
          
          <p> Students who demonstrate this effort by consistently attending Mr. Marlow's homework help sessions are far more likely to pass my courses than peers who do not. For any specific questions, please feel free to speak with or contact Mr. Jon Marlow (jmarlow@sbp.org).</p>

         <p class="margin-top-10"><strong>National Honor Society</strong></p>
      
      <p> The National Honor Society (NHS) is an organization within the school specifically maintained for the purposes of providing extra help to students. The St. Benedict's chapter of the NHS is led by four student officers – a President, Vice President of Tutoring, Vice President of Services, and Secretary. <strong>Each NHS member is required to perform fourteen (14) hours of community service each semester.</strong> This service includes tutoring at St. Benedict’s which all of my students are encouraged to take advantage of. Questions about the St. Benedict’s Chapter of the National Honor Society may be directed to its faculty advisors, James F. Duffy (jduffy@sbp.org) or Michelle Tuorto (mtuorto@sbp.org). <a href="help.html" title="NHS Tutoring" class="more">Click here</a> for more information. </p>
      
         <p class="margin-top-10"><strong>Br. Max's Homework Help - Radel Library</strong></p>
      
       <p> My older students are encouraged to contact Br. Max for extra help in the library after school. Similarly to the FY extra help, older students who demonstrate effort by working with Br. Max are far more likely to pass my courses than peers who do not. For any specific questions or to schedule an appointment, please speak with or contact Br. Maximilian Buonocore (mbuonocore@sbp.org).</p>
