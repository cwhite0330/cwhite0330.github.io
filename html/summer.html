  <div class="block">
      <p><span class="first-character ny">A</span>s high school students, the academic expectations for you have increased dramatically. Negative attitudes, tardiness, late homework, and laziness are <strong>not acceptable</strong>. All of your teachers here at St. Benedict's will expect more of you as students than before, as will your parents and friends. Life will get pretty hectic for you - very quickly. The secret to making your academic life here a success lies within your ability to <strong>stay on top of your work by being organized</strong>.</p> 

<p><strong>Basic Skill #2: Keep "your" world organized</strong>. As a kid, you have almost no control over your home. Your parent(s)/ guardian(s) make(s) the major decisions.</p>
 
<p>However, you do have full control over your academic life here at St. Benedict's. Your success or failure is entirely on you - regardless of what home looks like.</p>

<p>There are five parts to successfully organizing your academic life here (for any class):</p>

<p><strong>Part 1: Keep &amp; Use your Planner</strong></p> 

<p> Your planner will be one of your most useful tools during high school. If you are a freshman (FY), you should receive one during the overnight.</p>

      <p>The purpose of your planner is to help you organize the important information of your daily schedules. <strong><i>LIFE NOTES</i></strong>, so to speak. Your planner should hold all of your homework assignments, doctor's appointments, club meetings, sports practices, parties, etc... And follow the same guideleines of useful note taking.</p>
      
<p>Your planner must be neat and organized, and give you a brief and simple way to see your schedule and assignments for the day (week, month, or year).  Even if you are not a freshman, there are still practical ways to keep your life notes:</p>
      
<p><img src="../images/googlecalendar.png.gif" alt="Google Calendar" style=""> is a convenient way to create a cloud based planner that will sync with all of your devices both at school and at home. This service is incuded with your school gmail account, which you will (or should have) recieved during your orientation. Instructions for how to acess and utilize your Google calendar can be found <a href="help.html">here</a>.</p>

      <p><strong>Freshmen (FY)</strong>, you are allowed to utilize the functionality of Google calendar as your planner for my course. However, it may only be used as a <i>supplement</i>. You are still required to use the planner that was given to you during orientation. <strong>The organization and daily use of your planner will affect your overall grade</strong>. The Google calendar that syncs to your phone, tablet, and computer will serve as a back up.</p>

<p><strong>Part 2: Take Useful Notes (Every Day)</strong></p>

<p>We have already reviewed the guidelines and steps for useful note taking above. But you should take a few hours each week, to examine your notebook and the <a href="#firststeps">section above</a> to ensure that you are still on track.</p>    
      
<p><strong>Part 3: Organizing Your Physical School Materials</strong></p> 

<p> For my courses, you will be required to print out the vast majority our of class work on your own. To make matters worse, you will also receive paper materials (readings, project instructions, syllabi, permission slips, homework, reutrned quizzes, etc.) from all of your other classes.</p>
      
<p> Therefore, you need to keep the three major physical compents of your academic life in order:</p>
      
      <p><strong><u>Your Folders &amp; Notebooks</u>**</strong></p>
      
      <p>Don't just stuff or fold your handouts into a random notebook/ textbook!</p>
      
      <p>Keeping track of your papers has two obvious benefits: 1. You will be able to verify your grades with teachers and 2. Your handouts will serve as useful study aids for those upcoming quizzes and tests.</p>
      
      <p>Make a separate folder or binder for each class. This will allow you to have the most storage space per class.  Give each class folder a different, distinct design or color and label them all clearly with your name, the course, and your teacher's name.</p> 
          
          <p>Avoid jamming papers into the pockets of your binders. Use your commong sense; if your handouts cannot fit into your binder's pockets, grab a simple three hole puncher - at least one of your teachers will have access to one.</p>
      
      <p>Also, be sure to get a separate notebook for each of your classes. <i>It may seem like a great idea to have one huge five subject notebook for all your classes</i>, but you'll just be creating a nightmare for yourself down the road.</p> 
      
      <p> <strong>If you misplace your "5 Subject Notebook", you will end up in serious trouble for all of your courses. </strong></p>
      
      <p> No teacher, on any level, is interested in hearing how you lost your homework when you misplaced your gigantic notebook. DO NOT BUY THEM! The best option for each of you, by far, is to have a separate notebook for each class. If for some legitimate reason you cannot obtain a separate notebook for each course, inform Mr. White of the problem, or at least reduce the likelyhood that you'll lose everything by purchasing the two or three subject ones.</p>
      
      <p> <strong>**Sprial Notebook Pockets</strong>: For your classes which are heavy on notes and light on handouts is also a fairly good system, if you can make it work. You are still encouraged to have one extra folder for each course just in case your handouts and returned assignments outgrow the pockets within your notebook.</p>
      
      <p><strong><u>Your Bookbag</u></strong></p>
      
      <p>Keep your bookbag in good shape. Students at St. Benedict's are not allowed to carry their bookbags with them during the day. So that should reduce the wear and tear on your backpack.</p>
      
      <p>Nevertheless, it is still impossible to be organized if your bookbag is littered with food wrappers and random scraps of paper. Clean out your bookbag frequently and keep it clean! Discard everything that is obviously garbage, and sort through the rest. Take your textbooks home (if your teacher gives you permission to do so) and keep your old assignments organized at home.</p>
      
      <p>Thankfully for you, all of my Algebra course materials are digital. But you will not have this luxury in all of your classes. Keep your notebooks, folders, and binder(s) organized. Your grades will be better for it in the end. <strong><i>N.B. If it is possible, keep a different bag for your practice gear as well. Mixing your practice gear with your class materials is often a recipe for disaster</i></strong>.</p>
      
      
      <p><strong><u>Your Locker</u></strong></p>
      
      <p> Don't jam your locker with loose handouts, old folders, and broken pencils. <strong>We do not allow locks on lockers here at St. Benedict's</strong>. So if your locker is always organized, you will reduce the chance of misplacing your things.</p> 
      
      <p>The easiest things to do, to help keep your locker organzed, are to: 1. Keep your notebooks, folders, and binder(s) organized. 2. Keep your bookbag is order. 3. Carry a seperate bag for your practice gear. </p>
      
      <p> One final simple idea would be to keep a plastic file organizer inside your locker.</p>
      
      <p>Plastic file accordions can serve as a simple filing system for all of your papers. These organizers are lightweight, compact, and easy to seperate into class specific sections.</p>
      
<p><strong>Part 4: Have an Organized Study Area at Home</strong></p>       

<p>Create a designated space for you to complete your homework at home. Your homework/ study space should be well lit, slightly uncomfrtable (to keep you awake), and well organized. You should have enough space to neatly store and returned assignments, handouts, study materials, and your textbooks.</p>
      
<p>If for whatever reason, studying at home is not a viable option for you, speak to someone about the issue immediately - your counselor, a teacher, a coach, or your group advisor. The property of St.Benedict's is essentially open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. </p>

<p><strong>Complete your homework at school, after practice and before you return home if you have to. Find a way to make your life work!</strong></p>
      
      
<p><strong>Part 5: Develop Good Interpersonal Habits</strong></p> 
    <p>Remember, that your success is entirely dependant on you:</p>
       <ul>
           <li><strong>Routine, routine, routine!</strong> Following the same habits everyday will make you a better student.</li>
       <li>Communicate effectively with your teachers and older peers. No one will want to help you if you are disrespectful.</li>
       <li>Don't be bashful! Ask for help if you need it. No one can do it all alone. ASK and you will receive the assistance that you need.</li>
           <li><strong>COLLABORATE</strong>. I encourage my students to work together. However, there is a distinct different between working together and cheating (copying answers).</li>
           <li><strong>Be on time for school and each of your classes. Your presence matters to the rest of us!</strong></li>
    </ul>
